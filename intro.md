## Goals

### What You Will Learn
* Why use screensraping?
* The structure of a webpage
* Selecting html nodes using CSS selectors
* Using R's `rvest` package for scraping content
* A tiny bit about tidyverse-style R coding
* Maybe (though probably not) using R's `stringr` package to clean up imported web data

### What You Will _Not_ Learn
* Web crawling
* Writing great R code, or really much about coding in R; I'll focus on the webscraping and may gloss over aspects of R
* How to scrape from very complex pages, e.g. those built as javascript applications

## Your Goals
* Not everyone will or should have the same learning goal
* Some of you will be able to do this yourself, but will still need to read documentation/tutorials (I do!)
* Some of you will get a very good sense of how this works -- that's great! Coding is learned by repetition

## Workshop basics
* If you're struggling with something, please ask. Someone else is struggling with the same thing.
* If you need technical help, we have two "runners" who will be able to help you throughout the workshop
* You should have a green and a yellow post-it at your seat. When we're working on a task, please use the yellow post it to signal that you need help. Use the green one to signal you're done.

## Installing
* You should have R and R Studio installed on your computer already. If not, please do so now.
* Please start R studio now
* Please install the `rvest`, the `stringr`, and the  `magrittr` package.
```
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("rvest")
install.packages("magrittr")
```
